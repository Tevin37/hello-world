My very first GitHub Repository Tutorial
H1! My name is Tevin. This is my first time using GitHub. I've attended some college for 4 years focusing on Web Programming. Afterwards i decided to further educate myself by free lancing a little bit. I currently use Sublime Text Editor 2, and Interactive Ruby(IRB). I do know HTML/CSS and Javascript. Hopefully this will help me obtain a job postion in the field.
